# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
The project is an example of a travel planner where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. 
APIs I used:
`Dark Sky API` - to get the weather from specific coordinates
`Geonames API` - to get coordinates
`Pixabay API` - to display an image of the location entered

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` to corresponding folder and run
```
npm install
```
to install dependencies and set up environment.
3. Then you'll need to create a new `.env` file  in the project root directory and set the API `id` and `key` from
4. Run this command to start the server
```
npm start
```
## Usage
Enter destination
Enter date
Hit the "Search" button
